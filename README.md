# ORACLE - Artifical-Intelligence-Home-Assistant

My graduation project that i am developing with Python and JavaScript.

Project includes interface where users can use to look at their emails, send emails, take notes, watch films, listen to music, set alarms, schedule their plans on calendar, calculate their calories and plan their diets, set a timer, create and edit to-do lists, look at weather informations etc.

Also users can do all of this both with speech recognition and with manual control.

Also users can communicate with Oracle, get responses from her according what users say. She can do all this work for you automatically and also using her brain at couple of subjects.

#Artifical Intelligence

If you give her a good night every night she can advice you tomorrow about your sleep routine, she can warn you, suggest idea, or congrats you.
If you going to buy a car and thinking how much you should pay for it, you can give her the specifications and she'll do the rest for you.
She can give you recommendation about the weather. About how Ä±t's going to be and what you should wear that day.
You wondering what you'll reading next ? She can give you 20 books that fit your liking.
She can give you recommendation about what you'll eat by just looking at what you did eat that day. She give you the best option by not calculating calorie needs by also calculating what nutrition you need most.

She also has a body, build on a Raspberry Pi and use DC Motors to move, distance sensors and servo motors to plan her way.
